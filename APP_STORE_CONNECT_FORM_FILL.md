### Notes (4000 characters max)

```
Thank you for reviewing TipFly AI!

This app helps tip-based workers track their earnings, predict future income using AI, and manage team tip pools.

Key features to test:
1. Sign up for a new account (email verification is automatic)
2. Add tip entries by tapping the "+" button (use any amount and date)
3. View AI predictions on the Analytics tab
4. Create a team pool under Settings > Teams
5. Test clock in/out functionality

All features work without special permissions except:
- Camera access is optional (for future receipt scanning feature)
- Notifications are optional (for team pool updates)

The app stores all data in Supabase (our secure backend). Email verification is sent automatically via Resend.

Support is available via in-app contact form in Settings, which sends messages to our support Discord channel.

Feel free to explore all features. Everything works right out of the box!

3. Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings
