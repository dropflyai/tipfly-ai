# TipFly AI — Stakeholder Interview Summary

**Date:** January 2025
**Stakeholders:** Erik (Founder/Developer) + Business Partner
**Interviewer:** Design Brain Process

---

## Vision & Goals

### Core Problem
Service workers (bartenders, servers, delivery drivers) don't track their tips, leading to:
- No understanding of earning patterns
- No ability to plan/predict income
- Tax season chaos
- Difficulty proving income for apartments/loans

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Users | 400 | End of year |
| Minimum viable | 100 | End of year (failure below this) |
| First milestone | 25 | Near-term |
| Key metric | Premium conversion rate | Ongoing |

### What TipFly MUST Do Well
1. **Best tip tracking experience** — Fast, frictionless entry
2. **Valuable analytics** — Show earnings per shift
3. **Planning & prediction** — Help users optimize their schedule

### Failure Definition
- Less than 100 users by end of year

## Target Users

### Primary Persona
- **Age:** Young (18-35 primarily)
- **Tech comfort:** Tech-savvy, comfortable with apps and AI
- **Industry:** Service industry — bartenders, servers, restaurant workers
- **Income:** Most of their income comes from tips
- **Current behavior:** Most don't track tips at all

### Anti-Persona (NOT our user)
- People unfamiliar with apps/AI/tech
- Wouldn't know where to find the app
- Not mobile-native

### User Insight
> "A lot of people don't track their tips" — This is both the challenge (no established habit) and opportunity (blue ocean)

## Business Context

### Business Model
- **Free tier:** 30-day history, basic features
- **Premium:** $2.99/month or $19.99/year
- **Key metric to optimize:** Premium conversion

### Team & Resources
- 2-person team (founder + business partner)
- Marketing budget: Higgsfield (AI video generation)
- Technical: React Native/Expo, Supabase, RevenueCat, Claude AI

### Competitors
- TipSee, Tip Tracker, spreadsheets, nothing

## Brand & Design

### Brand Personality (3 words)
1. **Future-thinking** — Modern, AI-powered, ahead of the curve
2. **Upbeat** — Positive, encouraging, celebrates wins
3. **Resourceful** — Practical tools that actually help

### Emotional Target
When users open the app, they should feel:

- Primary: Electric Blue (#00A8E8)
- Accent: Gold (#FFD700) for money/premium moments

---

## Technical Constraints

### Version Control Strategy
- Create feature branch for any design changes
- Test on emulator before iOS deployment
- Ability to revert to current version if needed
- Current version = baseline to preserve

### Platform
- iOS (App Store) — Primary
- React Native/Expo
- Must test thoroughly before TestFlight push

## Key Insights

1. **Conversion is king** — Premium conversion is the #1 metric
2. **No established habit** — Users don't currently track, so we're building a new behavior
3. **Young & tech-savvy** — Can use modern UI patterns, AI features
4. **Excitement over obligation** — App should feel fun, not like a chore
5. **Planning value** — Analytics that help users plan their schedule is key differentiator

## Open Questions for Research

1. What do competitor apps (TipSee, Tip Tracker) look like?
2. What UX patterns drive premium conversion in freemium apps?
3. What makes tip entry "exciting" vs. tedious?
4. How do we build a tracking habit in users who don't track?

## Next Steps

1. Research competitor apps
2. Create git branch for design refinements
3. Apply Design Brain principles
4. Test on emulator
5. Iterate based on findings
